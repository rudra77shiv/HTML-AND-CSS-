      The Atharva Veda (Sanskrit:
      &#2309;&#2341;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2357;&#2375;&#2342;&#2307;,
      Atharvaveda&#7717; from atharv&#257;&#7751;as and veda, meaning
      &quot;knowledge&quot;) is the &quot;knowledge storehouse of
      atharv&#257;&#7751;as, the procedures for everyday life&quot;. The text is
      the fourth Veda, but has been a late addition to the Vedic scriptures of
      Hinduism.
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      The language of the Atharvaveda is different from Vedic Sanskrit,
      preserving pre-Vedic Indo-European archaisms. It is a collection of 730
      hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into 20 books. About a sixth of
      the Atharvaveda texts adapts verses from the Rigveda, and except for Books
      15 and 16, the text is in poem form deploying a diversity of Vedic
      matters. Two different recensions of the text &ndash; the Paippal&#257;da
      and the &#346;aunak&#299;ya &ndash; have survived into modern times.
      Reliable manuscripts of the Paippalada edition were believed to have been
      lost, but a well-preserved version was discovered among a collection of
      palm leaf manuscripts in Odisha in 1957.
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the &quot;Veda of magical
      formulas&quot;, a description considered incorrect by other scholars. In
      contrast to the 'hieratic religion' of the other three Vedas, the
      Atharvaveda is said to represent a 'popular religion', incorporating not
      only formulas for magic, but also the daily rituals for initiation into
      learning (upanayana), marriage and funerals. Royal rituals and the duties
      of the court priests are also included in the Atharvaveda.
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      The Atharvaveda was likely compiled as a Veda contemporaneously with
      Samaveda and Yajurveda, or about 1200 BC &ndash; 1000 BC. Along with the
      Samhita layer of text, the Atharvaveda includes a Brahmana text, and a
      final layer of the text that covers philosophical speculations. The latter
      layer of Atharvaveda text includes three primary Upanishads, influential
      to various schools of Hindu philosophy. These include the Mundaka
      Upanishad, the Mandukya Upanishad and the Prashna Upanishad.
