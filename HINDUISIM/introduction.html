      Hinduism is the oldest religion in the world, originating in Central Asia
      and the Indus Valley, still practiced in the present day. The term
      Hinduism is what is known as an exonym (a name given by others to a
      people, place, or concept) and derives from the Persian term Sindus
      designating those who lived across the Indus River. Adherents of the faith
      know it as Sanatan Dharma (&ldquo;eternal order&rdquo; or &ldquo;eternal
      path&rdquo;) and understand the precepts, as set down in the scriptures
      known as the Vedas, as having always existed just as Brahman, the Supreme
      Over Soul from whom all of creation emerges, has always been. Brahman is
      the First Cause which sets all else in motion but is also that which is in
      motion, that which guides the course of creation, and creation itself.
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      Accordingly, one may interpret Hinduism as monotheistic (as there is one
      god), polytheistic (as there are many avatars of the one god),
      henotheistic (as one may choose to elevate any one of these avatars to
      supremacy), pantheistic (as the avatars might be interpreted as
      representing aspects of the natural world), or even atheistic as one might
      choose to replace the concept of Brahman with one's self in striving to be
      the best version of one's self. This belief system was first set down in
      writing in the works known as the Vedas during the so-called Vedic Period
      c. 1500 - c. 500 BCE but the concepts were transmitted orally long before.
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      There is no founder of Hinduism, no date of origin, nor &ndash; according
      to the faith &ndash; a development of the belief system; the scribes who
      wrote the Vedas are said to have been simply recording that which had
      always existed. This eternal knowledge is known as shruti (&ldquo;what is
      heard&rdquo;) and is set down in the Vedas and their various
      sections&nbsp;known as the Samhitas, Aranyakas, Brahmanas, and,&nbsp;most
      famously, the Upanishads, each of which addresses a different aspect of
      the faith.
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      The history of Hinduism covers a wide variety of related religious
      traditions native to the Indian subcontinent.[1] Its history overlaps or
      coincides with the development of religion in the Indian subcontinent
      since the Iron Age, with some of its traditions tracing back to
      prehistoric religions such as those of the Bronze Age Indus Valley
      Civilization. It has thus been called the &quot;oldest religion&quot; in
      the world.[note 1] Scholars regard Hinduism as a synthesis of various
      Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots[15] and no single
      founder.note
    </p>
    <p class="style4">
      The history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development. The
      first period is the pre-Vedic period, which includes the Indus Valley
      Civilization and local pre-historic religions, ending at about 1750 BCE.
      This period was followed in northern India by the Vedic period, which saw
      the introduction of the historical Vedic religion with the Indo-Aryan
      migrations, starting somewhere between 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE.The subsequent
      period, between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, is &quot;a turning point between the
      Vedic religion and Hindu religions&quot;and a formative period for
      Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Epic and Early Puranic period, from c.
      200 BCE to 500 CE, saw the classical &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hinduism
      (c. 320-650 CE), which coincides with the Gupta Empire. In this period the
      six branches of Hindu philosophy evolved, namely Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya,
      Vaisheshika, M&#299;m&#257;&#7747;s&#257;, and Vedanta. Monotheistic sects
      like Shaivism and Vaishnavism developed during this same period through
      the Bhakti movement. The period from roughly 650 to 1100 CE forms the late
      Classical period or early Middle Ages, in which classical Puranic Hinduism
      is established, and Adi Shankara's influential consolidation of Advaita
      Vedanta.
