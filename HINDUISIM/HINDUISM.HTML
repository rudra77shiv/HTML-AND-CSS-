      Hinduism is the world&rsquo;s oldest religion, according to many scholars,
      with roots and customs dating back more than 4,000 years. Today, with
      about 900 million followers, Hinduism is the third-largest religion behind
      Christianity and Islam. Roughly 95 percent of the world&rsquo;s Hindus
      live in India. Because the religion has no specific founder, it&rsquo;s
      difficult to trace its origins and history. Hinduism is unique in that
      it&rsquo;s not a single religion but a compilation of many traditions and
      philosophies.
    </p>
    <p align="left" class="style6">
      Hinduism includes a range of philosophies and is linked by shared
      concepts, recognisable rituals,cosmology pilgrimage to sacred sites and
      shared textual resources that discuss theology, philosophy, mythology
      Vedic Yajna yoga agamic rituals and temple building among other
      topics.Hinduism prescribes the eternal duties, such as honesty, refraining
      from injuring living beings , patience, forbearance, self-restraint,
      virtue, and compassion, among others.Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs
      include the four Purusarthas, the proper goals or aims of human life ,
      namely, dharma
      (ethics/duties),artha(prosperity/work),kama(desires/passions) and
      moksha(liberation/freedom from the cycle of death and rebirth salvation)as
      well as karma(action, intent and consequences) and samsara(cycle of death
      and rebirth).

    <ul class="style6">
      <li>
        Hinduism embraces many religious ideas. For this reason, it&rsquo;s
        sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;way of life&rdquo; or a &ldquo;family
        of religions,&rdquo; as opposed to a single, organized religion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most forms of Hinduism are henotheistic, which means they worship a
        single deity, known as &ldquo;Brahman,&rdquo; but still recognize other
        gods and goddesses. Followers believe there are multiple paths to
        reaching their god.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hindus believe in the doctrines of samsara (the continuous cycle of
        life, death, and reincarnation) and karma (the universal law of cause
        and effect).
      </li>
      <li>
        One of the key thoughts of Hinduism is &ldquo;atman,&rdquo; or the
        belief in soul. This philosophy holds that living creatures have a soul,
        and they&rsquo;re all part of the supreme soul. The goal is to achieve
        &ldquo;moksha,&rdquo; or salvation, which ends the cycle of rebirths to
        become part of the absolute soul.
      </li>
      <li>
        One fundamental principle of the religion is the idea that
        people&rsquo;s actions and thoughts directly determine their current
        life and future lives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hindus strive to achieve dharma, which is a code of living that
        emphasizes good conduct and morality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hindus revere all living creatures and consider the cow a sacred animal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Food is an important part of life for Hindus. Most don&rsquo;t eat beef
        or pork, and many are vegetarians.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hinduism is closely related to other Indian religions, including
        Buddhism Sikhism and Jainism.
