      The Samaveda (Sanskrit: &#2360;&#2366;&#2350;&#2357;&#2375;&#2342;,
      s&#257;maveda, from s&#257;man &quot;song&quot; and veda
      &quot;knowledge&quot;), is the Veda of melodies and chants.It is an
      ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, and part of the scriptures of Hinduism. One
      of the four Vedas, it is a liturgical text which consists of 1,549 verses.
      All but 75 verses have been taken from the Rigveda. Three recensions of
      the Samaveda have survived, and variant manuscripts of the Veda have been
      found in various parts of India.
    </p>
    <p class="style3">
      The Samaveda is shortest of all the four Vedas. It is closely connected
      with the Rigveda. It is important to note that the Samhita of the Samaveda
      is an independent collection (Samhita), yet it has taken many verses, a
      large number indeed, from the Samhita of Rigveda. These verses are chiefly
      derived from the eighth and the ninth Mandalas of the Rigveda. The
      Samaveda is compiled exclusively for ritual application, for its verses
      are all meant to be chanted at the ceremonies of the Soma-sacrifice and
      procedures derived from it. The Samaveda is, therefore, specially intended
      for the&nbsp;<em>Udagatr&nbsp;</em>priest. Its stanzas assume their proper
      character of musical&nbsp;<em>samans&nbsp;</em>or chants only in the
      various song-books called&nbsp;<em>Ganas</em>. According to the Jaiminiya
      Sutra &ndash; &lsquo;Melody is called Saman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="style3">
      Traditional the Vedas are spoken as<em>&lsquo;Trayi</em>&lsquo;, because
      thay are composed of three kinds in mantras- Rcs or verses, Yajus or
      prose, Saman or chants.
    </p>
    <p class="style3">
      Among the four Vedas, the Samaveda is regarded as the foremost. In the
      Bhagavadgata, where Lord Krishna has declared &ldquo;Among the Vedas I am
      Samaveda&rdquo;-<em>Vedanama Samavedosmi</em>&nbsp;(Gita, 10.22). Here
      Indra, Agni and Soma deities are mainly invoked and praised but most of
      the time these prayers seem to be the invocations for the Supreme Being.
      In the spiritual sense Soma represents All-pervading, Glorious Lord and
      Brahman, who is attainable only through devotion and musical chanting.
      Thus major theme of the Samaveda can be regarded as worship and devotion
      (<em>Upasana</em>).
    </p>
    <p class="style3">
      The Samaveda is the Veda of Chants, or &quot;storehouse of knowledge of
      chants&quot;. According to Frits Staal, it is &quot;the Rigveda set to
      music&quot;. It is a fusion of older melodies (s&#257;man) and the Rig
      verses. It has far fewer verses than Rigveda, but Samaveda is textually
      larger because it lists all the chant- and rituals-related score
      modifications of the verses.The Samaveda text contains notated melodies,
      and these are probably the world's oldest surviving ones. The musical
      notation is written usually immediately above, sometimes within, the line
      of Samaveda text, either in syllabic or a numerical form depending on the
      Samavedic Sakha (school).
