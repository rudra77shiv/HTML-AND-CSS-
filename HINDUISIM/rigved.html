        >The Rigveda or Rig Veda is an ancient Indian collection of Vedic
        Sanskrit hymns. It is one of the four sacred canonical texts
        (&#347;ruti) of Hinduism known as the Vedas.</span
      >
    </h1>
    <p class="style8">
      The Rigveda is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text. Its early layers are
      one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language.The sounds
      and texts of Rigveda have been orally transmitted since the 2nd millennium
      BCE. The philological and linguistic evidence indicates that the bulk of
      the Rigveda Samhita was composed in the northwestern region of the Indian
      subcontinent, most likely between c. 1500 and 1000 BCE, although a wider
      approximation of c. 1700&ndash;1000 BCE has also been given.
    </p>
    <p class="style8">
      The text is layered consisting of the Samhita, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and
      Upanishads. The Rigveda Samhita is the core text, and is a collection of
      10 books (ma&#7751;&#7693;alas) with 1,028 hymns (s&#363;ktas) in about
      10,600 verses (called &#7771;c, eponymous of the name Rigveda). In the
      eight books &ndash; Books 2 through 9 &ndash; that were composed the
      earliest, the hymns predominantly discuss cosmology and praise deities.
      The more recent books (Books 1 and 10) in part also deal with
      philosophical or speculative questions, virtues such as d&#257;na
      (charity) in society, questions about the origin of the universe and the
      nature of the divine, and other metaphysical issues in their hymns.

    <p class="style8">
      : The Rig Veda is the oldest of the works comprised of 10 books (known as
      mandalas) of 1,028 hymns of 10,600 verses. These verses concern themselves
      with proper religious observance and practice, based on the universal
      vibrations as understood by the sages who first heard them, but also
      address fundamental questions regarding existence.

      whole? Questions of how, what, and why are the beginning of philosophical
